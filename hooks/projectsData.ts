			<p><strong>Built with WordPress</strong> — Travellers Autobarn is a visually striking travel and booking portal created by DevCritters on <strong>WordPress with custom themes</strong>. It serves adventurers looking to rent or buy campervans across Australia, with a custom booking engine and location-based content.</p>

			<p><strong>The challenge:</strong> The client needed a booking-focused website that could handle campervan rental and sales, multiple locations, real-time availability, and a strong brand experience — all easy for their team to update without heavy developer dependency.</p>

			<p>This WordPress website features a highly customized booking engine on the homepage: users select pickup/drop-off locations and dates for real-time availability and a smooth reservation flow. Interactive location services and itinerary guides help plan "Coast to Coast" journeys, while the site clearly separates rental and sales funnels for different customer needs.</p>

			<p><strong>Key features:</strong> Custom booking engine on homepage, pickup/drop-off and date selection, real-time availability, rental vs sales funnels, location and itinerary content, inventory and offers management, and full mobile responsiveness.</p>

			<p>Bold imagery and a clean layout match the adventure brand, while the WordPress backend manages inventory, special offers, and location-specific content.</p>

			<p><strong>Why WordPress:</strong> This project shows how a web agency can transform WordPress with custom theming and plugins into a modern, high-converting solution for travel and tourism. WordPress was chosen for its flexibility, content management, and ability to support complex booking and multi-location sites.</p>
